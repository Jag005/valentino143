Vaentino – Valentine’s Day Interactive Project

Vaentino is a fun and romantic Valentine’s Day project designed to create a personalized and interactive love experience. The project begins by asking the user to enter their name and then presents a sweet proposal asking them to be your Valentine. It is designed to bring smiles, emotions, and a special feeling through a creative web experience.

After the proposal, the project shows romantic details about the first meeting and Valentine’s moments, along with cheerful and heartwarming visuals. It creates a storytelling experience that makes the interaction feel personal and meaningful. The next page focuses on emotions, expressing love through thoughtful messages and expressive design elements that enhance the romantic theme.

The final part of the project includes a fun and engaging mini-game. In this game, the user collects hearts, and the more hearts they gather, the higher the love percentage increases. This interactive element adds excitement and playfulness to the overall experience.

Vaentino is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining creativity, storytelling, and simple game mechanics into one complete Valentine’s Day themed project. It was created to celebrate love in a unique and enjoyable way through code. ❤️
